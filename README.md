Problem Statement

Debating, public speaking, and interviewing are essential skills for personal and professional achievement. Yet, most individuals have problems with nervousness, poor vocabulary, weak articulation, or fuzzy thinking. Conventional coaching is expensive, time-consuming, and out of reach.
FluentAI seeks to deliver an AI-based solution that provides real-time feedback, customized improvement plans, and an interactive practice space to improve communication skills.

->Debate Mode: AI plays the role of a debate opponent, presenting counterarguments and rating the user's reasoning, coherence, and confidence.

->AI Feedback: Utilizes speech recognition, NLP, and computer vision to evaluate speech clarity, argument strength, and body language.

->Progress Tracking: Monitors progress over time, ranks users, and offers motivational insights.
